Simple Protocol Buffers
=======================

This is a copy of the project that Google has that implements Protocol Buffers in a manner
that is cross language and is done off of their `.proto` files. 

It is done by describing the protocol messages through python classes.

    class Person( Protocol ):
     first_name = String( 10 ) #Max string length of 10.
     last_name = String( 10 )  #Max string length of 10.
     age = Int()               #Keep track of their age.


The above class very simply describes the data in the message and provides a few
constraints on the length of the first and last name strings.

Then to actually create a message you simply do the following:

    person = Person()

    me = person.new( first_name="Sean", last_name="Reed", age=10 )

This will print out the pretty print version of this class.

    print me.encode()

This will print out the binary encoded value.


That's all there is to make your protocol buffer classes and use them.
